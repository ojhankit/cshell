# CShell
A simple Unix-like shell written in C. Supports basic commands, I/O redirection, and process handling.

## Features
- Run external commands (e.g. `ls`, `echo`, `cat`)
- Input and output redirection (`<` and `>`)
- Supports pipes (`|`)
- Handles Ctrl+C (SIGINT) gracefully

## Roadmap
- Background jobs (&)
- Job control with `fg`, `bg`
- Environment variables
- Command history
- Better signal handling (SIGCHLD, SIGTSTP)
